He asks whether Apple will get its mojo back and what will Microsoft do? Patel: Can Facebook grow up, and will Amazon be able to compete with Google?	Microsoft has been very candid about "missing a generation" of mobile innovation after Apple introduced the iPhone, and 2012 was all about the results of a furious catch-up effort: the company launched the completely rethought Windows 8 for PCs, Windows RT for tablets and Windows Phone 8 for smartphones.

Intelligence Committee chair says President should have been told of some spying. Officials say Obama didn't know about HealthCare.gov website glitches and U.S. spy programs. Analyst: "This has happened before. ... He has to be accountable for major decisions" Republican strategist: "There's really no good answer"	Questions about what the President knew and when he knew it have important implications, analysts told CNN on Monday. Problems in management, analysts say. Let us begin now to come up with models, alphas and betas and test runs, and call in the best people on the planet to make sure that we have a system that is ready to operate efficiently on opening day.'"

Reports say Google's YouTube is in talks to buy Twitch. Twitch is a website that focuses on live-streaming video games. It has quietly amassed a huge audience in a short time.

Despite a deal struck over Ukraine, the chances of a durable settlement remain slim, says Jonathan Eyal. Eyal: Putin's aim may be to destroy the nation, and condemn remaining western rump to status of failed state. Longer conflict goes on, less chances anyone has in controlling its protagonists, Eyal writes.	However, the latest Russian offensives indicate new objectives: Moscow's troops are consolidating the separatist rebel enclaves into one larger unit under Russian control, most likely as a prelude to Ukraine's permanent territorial division. The reality is that Ukraine's military does not need Western-made military equipment; it operates Russian or Soviet-made one. Russia is already finding it increasingly difficult to control ethnic Russian rebels in Ukraine, and that difficulty will only increase as times goes by.	Russian Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande proclaimed themselves satisfied with the deal. The deal aimed at imposing a ceasefire in Ukraine from this Sunday was concluded following talks between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. Yet despite 17 hours of talks in the Belarus capital of Minsk, during which President Vladimir Putin was seen breaking pencils on his desk in frustration, some of the agreement's most important provisions have yet to be clarified.	-0.0651991342997

Yet, citizens have a constitutional right to take employment. E-Verify essentially equates all Americans with "illegal immigrants."

Gingrich, Graham: U.S. has protested but hasn't gone beyond symbolic measures. They say Obama's meeting with Ukrainian leader and Kerry's condemnation aren't sufficient. Authors: U.S. should have accepted Ukraine's emergency request for military aid. They say it is crucial to send a message that the U.S. will respond strongly to aggression.	On Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the U.S. will take "very serious" steps if Russia does not back down by Monday from its attempt to annex Crimea. Unless the President is willing to back up his words with military aid, he's not serious about stopping Putin's armed aggression. Russian occupation of the rest of Ukraine would be a vastly more threatening and more aggressive action. Trouble there could "reset" us right back to direct warfare with Russia. That would be a disaster and very, very dangerous.	Arseniy Yatsenyuk: America will take "very serious" steps if Russia does not back down by Monday. On Thursday, President Barack Obama hosted Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the new interim Ukrainian Prime Minister, for lunch at the White House, supposedly a thumb in the eye of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a sign of America's commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. Putin has amassed 80,000 Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, and we are worried about "inflaming tensions"?	-0.086893175074

Some Web commenters say they don't see the point of the new iPad Mini. Consumers could get whiplash from how phones, tablets have grown and shrunk in size. As phones and tablets seem to merge, manufacturers must find that sweet spot in between.

Apple is preparing to launch iCloud, an Internet storage service. Amazon already has Cloud Drive, and Google has a variety of services. iCloud is tightly integrated into Apple software but seemingly less so in other platforms.	Google does not have a music store. Cloud Drive offers 5 gigabytes (about 1,000 songs) free, and provides an extra 20 gigabytes for a year to customers who buy an album from Amazon's MP3 Store. Each gigabyte after that costs $1. Google's Music service is free this year if you can procure an invitation to join, and Google has not announced pricing for after that. So we're making it free," Jobs said. Music Beta is currently storing 20,000 songs free.	Apple is the world's most popular jukebox software, highest - volume music retailer. Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services. Apple's Cloud Drive and Google's music Beta require users to upload their entire libraries to each service before they can be accessed from Web and mobile jukeboxes.	-0.115258871667

Analysts say Amazon.com's Kindle Fire will cost more to build than $199. Selling the tablet for $199 is very aggressive compared to the $499 iPad. Amazon is apparently hoping to make up the losses on media sales.	According to analysts' estimates, the company couldn't. When factoring in marketing and other costs, Munster's estimate could jibe with iSuppli's. Amazon is making a potentially expensive entrance into the tablet market with its aggressively priced tablet. Factoring in projections for all of the e-books, music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device, Amazon is expected to turn a profit of $10 per Fire, iSuppli said in a statement. By contrast, Apple's iPad 2, the most popular tablet, costs $333.25 to make, iSuppli says.	Amazon will sell the Kindle Fire at a loss when it debuts on November 15. The Internet's largest retailer is apparently aiming to make up the costs by selling other goods, as it and other retail giants such as Wal - mart Stores often do. The preliminary estimate is typically based on analysts' talks with people in the supply chain and does not change significantly once iSuppli is able to tear down the hardware for a thorough report, executives say.	-0.00576329574418
Evidence indicates that the NSA stores contents of phone conversations and e-mails. NSA can investigate only when it can show reason it might be linked to foreign threat. Christopher Slobogin: If it is monitoring many thousands of calls, are all those justified? Slobogin: Congress must make sure the NSA abides by the laws it has enacted.	Recent revelations, triggered by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden's earlier disclosures, indicate that the National Security Agency not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use, it routinely stores the contents of phone conversations, text messages, e-mails and Internet activity. The key question then becomes when the NSA may "query" or identify the source of the metadata it has stored and read the communications it has collected.	Edward Snowden's earlier disclosures indicate that the National security Agency not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use, it routinely stores the contents of phone conversations, text messages, e - mails and Internet activity. If they were followed, the European naysayers about the NSA's exploits would not be so hot under the collar. The NSA may not conduct queries or identify the source of the metadata it has stored and read the communications it has collected.	-0.10610476224

Google has appointed lawyers to work with developers on new products. For the first time, Google canned a finished project due to privacy concerns. The product would have used facial recognition to find out who someone is.	 As recently as March, Google still had plans to eventually release the facial-recognition version of the app, CNN reported. Schmidt was less supportive of the idea at a conference two weeks ago when he said it was "unlikely" that Google would release the software.
