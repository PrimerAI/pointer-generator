CEO Marissa Meyer is reportedly looking for four 30-minute, 10 episode comedies produced by television industry veterans. The company has already reviewed more than 100 potential pilots and is looking to have deals in place within the coming weeks. Microsoft signed up Sarah Silverman and Seth Green for its shows, with a dozen pilots in development. The shows would allow Yahoo to charge premium rates for video advertisements that would bolster sagging revenues.
