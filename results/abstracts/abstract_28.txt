San Francisco startup Vicarious is building software designed to mimic the behaviour of the brain's neocortex. The neocortex is the part of the brain involved in thought and language. Vicarious wants to create a system 'that thinks and learns like a human’. Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla’s Elon Musk are the latest backers. Others include PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and actor Ashton Kutcher.
