President Obama announced changes in a speech on Friday morning. Government control of phone-call data 'creates a potential for abuse,' he acknowledged. Obama wouldn't recommend who should control the digital information, but told AG Eric Holder and Congress to decide the future of the program. Speech came after months-long review following a public description of the program by NSA leaker Edward Snowden in 2013. NSA initiative is meant to stockpile data so it can be mined later to draw lines of connection among suspected terrorists after they are identified.
