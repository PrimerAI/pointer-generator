At least two videos, in California and Florida, have been posted online. This suggests the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. Rumours range from a Street View-style  service to a Tesla-style electric car. In the Florida video, the passenger is seen concealing an iPad . The far-reaching nature of the project adds  weight to mapping rumours. But reports claims Apple is building a self-driving 'Titan' car in a secret lab. Alternatively, the tech giant could be using the vehicles for both projects    .
