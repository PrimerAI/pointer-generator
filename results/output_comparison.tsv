Despite a deal struck over Ukraine, the chances of a durable settlement remain slim, says Jonathan Eyal. Eyal: Putin's aim may be to destroy the nation, and condemn remaining western rump to status of failed state. Longer conflict goes on, less chances anyone has in controlling its protagonists, Eyal writes.

The reality is that Ukraine's military does not need Western-made military equipment; it operates Russian or Soviet-made one. Russia is already finding it increasingly difficult to control ethnic Russian rebels in Ukraine, and that difficulty will only increase as times goes by.

Since Apple introduced its iPad Mini on Tuesday, some commenters on CNN, Twitter and elsewhere have expressed skepticism about the need for the new device. In other news, Apple announced the iPad Mini today." Fueled by interest in watching video and playing games, smartphone screens have been gradually getting larger -- from about 3.5 inches, measured diagonally, to almost 5 inches. The original iPad and its first wave of rivals measured about 10 inches across, but more recent entries such as Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 have been 7 inches -- small enough to slip into a coat pocket.	The Mini is slightly larger than rival tablets from Amazon and Google. Prices start at $329, or $70 less than a full - size iPad 2 but $130 more than a comparable Kindle Fire HD. Apple's stock took a dive when the Mini's price was announced, and a search of the blogosphere found less excitement among consumers than what greeted the original iPad.	-0.429223144502
Apple is preparing to launch iCloud, an Internet storage service. Amazon already has Cloud Drive, and Google has a variety of services. iCloud is tightly integrated into Apple software but seemingly less so in other platforms.	Google does not have a music store. Cloud Drive offers 5 gigabytes (about 1,000 songs) free, and provides an extra 20 gigabytes for a year to customers who buy an album from Amazon's MP3 Store. Each gigabyte after that costs $1. Google's Music service is free this year if you can procure an invitation to join, and Google has not announced pricing for after that. So we're making it free," Jobs said. Music Beta is currently storing 20,000 songs free.	Apple is the world's most popular jukebox software, highest - volume music retailer. The free service lets users synchronize documents, photos and applications between Apple devices. Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services. The weeks - long process Jobs is referring to is the offerings from Amazon and Google.	-0.466990983319

Analysts say Amazon.com's Kindle Fire will cost more to build than $199. Selling the tablet for $199 is very aggressive compared to the $499 iPad. Amazon is apparently hoping to make up the losses on media sales.	According to analysts' estimates, the company couldn't. When factoring in marketing and other costs, Munster's estimate could jibe with iSuppli's. Amazon is making a potentially expensive entrance into the tablet market with its aggressively priced tablet. Factoring in projections for all of the e-books, music and video that customers will likely purchase for the device, Amazon is expected to turn a profit of $10 per Fire, iSuppli said in a statement. By contrast, Apple's iPad 2, the most popular tablet, costs $333.25 to make, iSuppli says.	Amazon will sell the Kindle Fire at a loss when it debuts on November 15, analysts say. The Internet's largest retailer is apparently aiming to make up the costs by selling other goods.

Evidence indicates that the NSA stores contents of phone conversations and e-mails. NSA can investigate only when it can show reason it might be linked to foreign threat. Christopher Slobogin: If it is monitoring many thousands of calls, are all those justified? Slobogin: Congress must make sure the NSA abides by the laws it has enacted.	Recent revelations, triggered by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden's earlier disclosures, indicate that the National Security Agency not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use, it routinely stores the contents of phone conversations, text messages, e-mails and Internet activity. The key question then becomes when the NSA may "query" or identify the source of the metadata it has stored and read the communications it has collected.	Ex - NSA employee Edward Snowden says NSA security Agency not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use, text messages, e - mails and Internet activity. Former Vice President Dick Cheney explains that the collection of all of this information is crucial, because NSA staffers can not know what bits of it will turn out to be relevant to a counterterrorist investigation. The key question is whether we follow those limitations.	-0.511796218661
U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security. Russia's foreign ministry vowed a continued "tough" offensive against terrorism. Two terrorist bombings hit Volgograd, killing more than 30 people. The attacks raised concerns about security at the Olympics in February.

Google has appointed lawyers to work with developers on new products. For the first time, Google canned a finished project due to privacy concerns. The product would have used facial recognition to find out who someone is.	 As recently as March, Google still had plans to eventually release the facial-recognition version of the app, CNN reported. Schmidt was less supportive of the idea at a conference two weeks ago when he said it was "unlikely" that Google would release the software. Regulators say Google has crossed that line before, with its camera-taking vehicles and with Google Buzz.	Google is striving to be more sensitive to data - collection issues that often make people uneasy. It went so far as to spike a recent project Google engineers had developed because of fears of potential backlash. The scrapped software would have let people include their head shot photos in a database so that they could be recognized by a mobile application when someone takes a picture of their faces.	-0.257450553601
